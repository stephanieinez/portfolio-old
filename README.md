## My Portfolio

### Motivation

I wanted to create a place to show off some of the projects that I have been working on. I had a little fun creating the design for this site, challenging myself to use lots of CSS!

### Code Style

As I will be adding more content to this site as time goes on, I stuck to React and CSS to keep it simple but dynamic.

_Site is deployed at https://stephanieinez.github.io._
